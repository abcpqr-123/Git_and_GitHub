// git clone 

// ==> git clone <url> 

// To clone a repo, run ==> git clone <url> (u have to copy the url from github)

// Git will retrieve all the files associated with the repository 
// and will copy them to ur local machine 

// In addition, Git initializes a new repository on ur machine, 
// giving u caccess to the full Git history of the cloned project 

// Ex: 
// imagine that ur in folder called cloning, 
// Note: make sure that git is not initialized in the folder in which u r 
// running the commad 
// to check that hit command ==> git status , 

// and once u r sure that there is not initialized ,

// u hit command
// ==> git clone <url>

// Note: whereever u run git clone, that is the place or folder where 
// git is going to create a new folder for u. 

// and u NEED INTERNET for this, 

// now a new folder will be created inside cloning folder by Git, 

// if u 
// ==> cd 
// into that foder, and hit 
// ==> ls 
// u can see the files and folders of that github repository which u 
// clolned. 

// and it will be a git repo, 

// if u hit
// ==>  git log , 
// u will be able to see the full commit history of that project
