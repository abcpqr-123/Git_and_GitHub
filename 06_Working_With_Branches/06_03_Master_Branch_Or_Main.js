// The master Branch: 

// In git, we are always working on a branch The default branch name is "master"

// It doesn't do anything special or have fancy powers. Its just like any
// other branch.

// Master

// Many people designate the master branch as their "source of truth" or "the official
// branch"  for there code base, but that is left for u to decide. 

// From the git perspective, the master branch is just like any other branch. It does 
// not have to hold the "master copy" of ur project 


//                     Master? 
//                     Main? 

// In 2020 Github renamed the default branch from master to main. but, 
// the default Git branch name is still master, though the Git team is exploring 
// a potential change.
