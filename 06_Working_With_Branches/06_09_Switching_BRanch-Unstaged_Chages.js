// before u switch branches its importent that u statge the changes and commit 

// If u wont do that then git will show woring: 
// * Your local changes to the following file will be over runned  
// * commit ur changes or stash them before switching branches 


// once u commit the changes then u can switch without any complaint 
// from the git.


// Note: note that if u make changes in branch whih conatiains a unique file 
//       name which no other file or folder has, then there will be no broblem 

//       u can switch the branch. that change which u did not commited 
//       will follow for every branch u go to 


//       BUT STILL ITS ALWAYS BETTER THAT U COMMIT THE CHANGES BEFORE U MOVE 
//       FROM ONE BRANCH TO ANOTHER BRANCH
