//  why u need git branching? 

//  On large projects we oftern worj in multiple contexts.. 


//  1. u r working on  2 different color schemes variations for 
//     ur website at the same thime, ensure of which u like best 


// 2. A teammate is also working on adding a new chat widget to present 
//    at the next meeting. Its unclear if ur company will end up using 
//    it. 

// 3. Another coworker is upadating the search bar autocomplete. 

// 4. Another developer is doing an experimental radiecal design 
//    over the entire layout to present next month 


// if they all work in linear fassion, one commit after the another it will 
// be impossible. 

// beacuse if someone is doing a radical experimental design change on every 
// single view of our application, at that situation every thing get changes
//       But if someone is trying to work on some minor color scheme variations, 
//       or 
//       if someone's workjing on adding a chat wisit to the bottom of our screen 
// those, things need to happen in separate contexts beacuse 
// they have implications on one anoteher and they need to happen in isolation until
// maybe at some at some point we may deside to encoparate each ouhers changes at 
// some point. 

 

// so that is where branching comes in that is what git allows us to do 




// Branches!: 

// Branches are an essential part of git! 

// Think of branches as alternative timelines for a project 

// They enable us to create separate contexts where we can try new 
// things, or even work on multiple ideas in parallel 

// If we make changes on one branch, they do not impact the ohter 
// branches(unless we merge the changes)
