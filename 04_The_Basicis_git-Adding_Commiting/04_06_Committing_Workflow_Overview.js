
// Each of the  checkpoints is while making a project is known as git commit 
// A git commit is one of these checkpioints in a git repostiory and typically 
// a single git repostiory 


// Note: its very crucial to understand about making a commit is that its 
// not the same as just saving a file. Its actually think of it as something 
// that's built on top of saving files. 

// We have to make changes first and save them into a file before and save them 
// to our files before we can even commit.
// So we might use the term check point or save point 


// But we're not talking about just saving a file that has nothing to do with 
// GIT. We save the file all the time, but once we have made changes , we can then 
// group them togetheer into a commit. 


// For example... 
// Imagin that we have 5 files of html, we can make changes in those files write some 
// code and save the changes in theose individual files. 
// then if we want, we can group them all together into a new commit. 

// //------------          ----        ----------

// GIT IS NOT ONLY CHANGING CODE IN THE FILE AND MAKING COMMITS... COMMITS... COMMMITS:
// Means, imagine that we made chages in 2 files, and deleted 1 file,
// and added 4 new files  
// we dont have to put all thse together and make 1 commit, 
// instead we can select 2 chagnes and 1 deleted file and make one commit, and
// put other 4 newly created files together and make another commit. 



// The Basic Git WorkFlow: 

// * WORK ON STUFF 
//   make new files, edit files, delete files, etc 

// * ADD CHANGES: 
//   Group specific changes together, in preparation of committing 

// * COMMIT: 
//   Commit everything that was previously added
