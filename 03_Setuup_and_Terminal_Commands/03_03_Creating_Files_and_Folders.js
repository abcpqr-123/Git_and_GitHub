// CREATE FILES:
// * touch  ==> Used to create a new file inside a directory 
                // Ex: If u want to create a new file - called app.js 
                //     then u can write: 
                // touch app.js 
                
                // app.js file will be created 

    //   Note: u can create MULTIPLE FILES by writing: 

    //   touch app1.js app2.js app3.js app4.js 


    // # If u want to create a file in a specific folder and u r not in that 
    //   folder then, u have mention the specific path of the folder in which
    //   u want 
    //    Ex: touch Desktop/Local_Storage/NewFile.js 
              







// CREATE FOLDERS:

// Note: While creating folders its recommended that u shoud not leave 
//       spaces between the worlds 

//       In case if u have then u can write like this: 
//       Ex: "New Folder"

// mkdir ==>  to create folders we do use mkdir means, make directory 

//            Ex: mkdir NewFolderGit 

// # If u want to create a sub folder in the folder in which u r not there 
//   right now, then u have to define complete path of that folder 

//   For Exmple, if u want to create a folder in desktop then     
//        Ex 1: mkdir Desktop/Git-Practic"new folder"
//        Ex 2: mkdir "new folder"/folder1/folder2




// multiple folders: 

// U can create multiple folders at a time
// Ex: mkdir folder1 folder2 folder3 folder4
