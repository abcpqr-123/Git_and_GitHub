// Note: This content is not that importent

// Linus Torvalds invented git. 

// He is the main person behind in the creation of Linux also 


// before git, he was working in a version control system called 
// * BitKeeper *. Due to some disagreements the users of BitKeeper
// didnot allow Linus Torvalds to use free version and they wanted 
// him to pay money 

// This became little contraversial 

// So Linus wanted to create something fast and open source 
// and he dedicated the month of April 2005 to create git and got 
// the basic functionalites ready.




// Reason behind the name git: 


// Tarvalds named git as 'The stupid content tracker' while he was working on 
// it then he chosed the name git. 

// The official Git Source code explains a couple different meanings for the name, 
// depending on your mood
