// Writing COmmit Messages

// Present or past tense? Does it really maters? 


// Present-Tense Imperative style?? 

// From the Git docs: 

// Describe ur changes in inperative mood, e.g 
// "make xyzzy do frontz"   instead of 
// "makes xyzzy do frontz" or "I changed xyzzy to do frontz", 
// as if u r giving orders to the codebase to change its behavior 


// ///----------------------------------------------------------

// IMP NOTE: 

// Well finally it depends on the organization or the comapany in which 
// u r working with 

// if the instruction for ur team is to make changes in the present tense
// then u make changes in preset tense 
// if they ask u to do in past then u do it in past tense
