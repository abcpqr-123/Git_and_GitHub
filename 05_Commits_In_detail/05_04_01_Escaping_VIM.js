// when we use git commit WITHOUT -m, it opens a default editor, and its 
// likely to be VIM. 

// if u type ==> git commit 
// now, the VIM is open 

// so once its open the first thing u have to do is type i --> STANDS FOR insert 
// and hit enter. now u r in insert mode 

// Now u can type ur insert message. 
// Ex: fixed the typo. 

// once u  r finised with ur message 

// NOW U HAVE TO GET OUT OF WIM. TO DO THAT: 

// u have to hit escape key once. by doing that u will leave the insert mode. 

// Now, u have to leave vim entirly. to do that: 

// u  have to  type it the bottom-->   :wq    here w stands for write 
//                                                 q stands for quit 
// So Basecally it means write and quit. 



// and IMPORTENT NOTE: 

// After completeing all the above steps if u r not able to type anything 
// then u have to peress  --> q + Enter 

// after that u will be able to enter any command u want.
