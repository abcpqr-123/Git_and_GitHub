// Some times we make very long commits which contiains many lines and 
// sometimes even paragrphs 

// when we hit ==> git log, it will be very hard to read all the messages
// which appear 

// so we use to FORMAT COMMITS 

// Once again if u want then u can get more info about this in git documentation 
// in git docs - git log 


// THERE ARE MANY FORMAT COMMITS, few improtent commits are: 

// ==> git log --abbrev-commit 

// it shows less and only imortent commits in comparison to git log 
// still its not engough, its better to git much more less info 
// in one single line for that we do use: ==>: git log --oneline 


// ==> git log --oneline 
// Ex: remove extra blank lines in chapter2
