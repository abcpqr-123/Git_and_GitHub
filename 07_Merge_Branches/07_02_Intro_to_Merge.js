// Merging: 

// Branching makes it super easy to work within self-connected cointexts 
// but 
// often we want to incorparate changes from one branch into another! 

// We merge by using: 

// ==> git merge <branchName>


// NOTE: 
// * WE MERGE BRANCHES, NOT SPECIFIC COMMITS 
// * WE ALWAYS MERGE TO THE CURRENT HEAD BRANCH (We merge to the branch where we are)




// SETPS OF MERGING: 

// * Switch or checkout the branch u want to merge the changes into 
//   (the receiving branch)

// ==> git switch master(if u want to merge the file into the master brach) 
//                      (else in the place of master u add the name of the file 
//                       which u want)


//  after that:


// * Use the git merge command to merge changes from a specific branch into 
//   the current branch. 

// ==> git merge <the Name Of The Branch Which U Want To  Merge>
